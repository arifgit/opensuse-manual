 <title>Using the KDE NetworkManager Front-End</title>

  The KDE front-end for NetworkManager is the NetworkManager plasmoid. If the network has been
  set up for NetworkManager control, the plasmoid usually starts automatically with
  the desktop environment and is shown as an icon in the system tray.
  </para>



 <para>
  If your system tray does not show any network connection icon, the
  plasmoid is probably not started. Click the <guimenu>Panel Tool
  Box</guimenu> and choose <guimenu>Add Widgets</guimenu>. Double-click 
  the <guimenu>Network Management</guimenu> entry and click the
  <guimenu>Panel Tool Box</guimenu> again.
 </para>

 <para>
  The NetworkManager front-end only shows wireless networks for which you have
  configured a connection. It hides connections when you are out of range of
  a wireless network, or when the network cable is disconnected, thus always
  giving you a clear view of which connections may be used.
 </para>

   By default the NetworkManager front-end only lists connections that are already
