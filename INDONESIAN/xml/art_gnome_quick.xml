 <abstract>
  <para>
  <phrase os="osuse">openSUSE®</phrase> provides the tools required by Linux* users for their daily activities. It has a user-friendly graphic environment (the GNOME* Desktop), which communicates with the Linux base system and allows access to files, folders, and programs, as well as their management. <phrase os="osuse">openSUSE</phrase> provides an integrated suite of applications for a wide range of office, multimedia, and Internet activities. It also contains the LibreOffice Suite which enables editing and saving of files in a variety of formats. The office suite is available for several operating systems, meaning you can use the same data across different computing platforms.

  <title>Getting Started</title>

  <para>
 When starting up your system, you will normally be asked to select your user name and enter your password. If someone else installed your system, ask your system administrator for your user name and password.
  </para>

  <para>
  The GNOME desktop appears after you first log in.  Its appearance depends on whether <phrase os="osuse">openSUSE®</phrase> could activate the 3D functions of your graphics card. Optics and functionality in both cases are the same, only the operation differs slightly.  
  </para>

 <sect1 id="sec.gnomequick.gnome.overview">
  <title>The standard GNOME desktop</title>

  <para>
  If <phrase os="osuse">openSUSE®</phrase> could activate the 3D functions, the GNOME desktop notifies you. The largest part is taken up by the initially still empty desktop with the green background image. You will see a narrow black bar on the top edge of the screen. This so-called panel allows you to access all functions and applications.  Specifically, it has the following elements:
  </para>

  <formalpara>
  <title>Time, calendar, and schedule planner:</title>
  <para>
  The current time is ticking in the middle. When you click on it, a small calendar appears which lists all pending appointments and events on the right hand side. You can call up time and date settings via the relevant buttons or start the calendar application directly (<guimenu>Open calendar</guimenu>).
  </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
  <title>Settings for accessibility:</title>
  <para>
  Clicking on the icon with the stylized little man opens different settings for accessibility. You can, for example, increase the contrast, switch on a screen keyboard or enlarge the font. To activate one of the functions, you must only right-click beside the slide switch.  An illuminated blue <guimenu>i</guimenu> marks a currently active function. Further <guimenu>settings for accessibility</guimenu> are behind the similarly named point.
  </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
  <title>Volume:</title>
  <para>
  The icon with the loudspeaker represents media volume. The more semicircles you can see, the louder your loudspeaker becomes. You can adjust the volume by clicking on the icon and dragging the white slider which appears when you press down the mouse button to the left or the right. To silence the sound, push the control all the way to the left. A little cross will be added to the loudspeaker icon. You can find additional settings for audio playback via the <guimenu>Sound Settings</guimenu> under the control.
  </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
  <title>Network:</title>
  <para>
  Clicking on the icon directly to the left beside the user name brings up a list with all network connections. The individual connections are sorted here according to their access type. For wireless connections (Wi-fi), small curved lines display the connection quality. A white lock icon indicates that use is only possible after entering a password.  You enter it by clicking on the corresponding connection. Whether a connection is active at all and is used by <phrase os="osuse">openSUSE®</phrase> is indicated by the illuminated blue <guimenu>I</guimenu> beside to the right. Click on the black switch in order to switch off a connection or explicitly switch it on again. If special settings for your hardware are needed or if problems appear, you can also quickly switch to <guimenu>Network Settings</guimenu> on the bottom edge of the list.

  <formalpara>
  <title>User menu:</title>
  <para>
  If you click on your name on the top right corner, a menu appears where you manage your user profile and your computer. If you use the immediate news program Empathy, you can change your availability status directly below your name. You can turn off the status messages with the switch underneath. This is useful if, for example, you want to concentrate on your work. You can save your access data for Google and Twitter under <guimenu>Online Accounts</guimenu>. You can reach the <guimenu>System Settings</guimenu> via the following menu points, where you can, for example, lock the screen for the duration of your lunch break, change to another user account, log off GNOME, or switch off the computer. You can also restart your PC via the last point. If <phrase os="osuse">openSUSE®</phrase> can use the energy-saving functions of your computer, the last menu item is called <guimenu>Readiness</guimenu>. This is how you switch your PC to hibernate mode. To go to the <guimenu>Switch Off</guimenu> menu item, hold down the <keycap function="alt"/> button.
  </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
  <title>Activities:</title>
  <para>
  Clicking <guimenu>Activities</guimenu> on the top left corner of the screen takes you to the so-called activities overview where you start programs and manage those already running. You also reach this view by placing the mouse pointer on the top left corner of the screen or pressing the <keycap>Windows</keycap> key (also called the <keycap>Super</keycap> key). You return to the normal view by clicking on <guimenu>Activities</guimenu>.
  </para>
  </formalpara>

  <formalpara>
  <title>Notifications panel:</title>
  <para>
  Whenever you insert a flash drive, finish downloading or some other important thing happens in your system, a corresponding message appears on the bottom edge of the screen. Some of these messages disappear quickly by themselves, others offer equally suitable actions. You can, for example, eject an inserted data CD immediately or open your content in a new window. If you do not wish to do any of the actions, simply click on the title of the message and it will then disappear from the bottom edge. Some messages deliver only a fragmentary short text. To find out more, slide the mouse pointer over the message and it will then expand completely. You can retrieve messages which have been clicked away or which have disappeared too early by clicking on <guimenu>Activities</guimenu> in the top left and then hovering the mouse pointer in the lower-right corner of the screen for a few seconds. The so-called notifications panel then appears. Clicking on one of the messages saved there is enough to retrieve the list with the matching actions.
  </para>

  <title>Start Programs </title>

  To start an application, first switch to the activities view (click on <guimenu>Activities</guimenu> or press the <keycap>Windows</keycap> button). You now have three options:

  <title>About the Dash (Favorites bar):</title>
  <para>
   Either click on the program icon in the bar on the left edge of the screen, the so-called Dash (sometimes also inconsistently called a Dock). If you hover over one of the icons with the mouse pointer, GNOME will tell you the name of the pertaining application.
  </para>
  </formalpara> <formalpara>
  <title>Via the applications view:</title>
  <para>
   If the desired program is missing in Dash, click on <guimenu>Applications</guimenu>. GNOME will then show all the installed programs.  You can move downwards in the list by pulling the ruler which is rather difficult to recognize in the narrow black bar slowly downwards with the left mouse button depressed. If you have installed a lot of programs or the list appears unclear to you, simply click on one of the categories on the right edge. GNOME then filters the diagram according to the corresponding field of application. For example, if you decide on the <guimenu>Graphics</guimenu> category, you see only all the available graphics programs.
  </para>
  </formalpara> <formalpara>
  <title>Via the search box:</title>
  <para>
   If you cannot find what you are looking for or when things have to get done quickly, the small search box on the right top will help. As soon as you enter a term there, GNOME will show all the matching applications and system settings. At the same time, you can also consult Wikipedia or Google via the corresponding buttons on the bottom edge. By the way, you do not have to click on the search box first, you can just simply begin typing directly.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.gnomequick.shell.window.management">
  <title>Manage Window</title>
  <para>
  After you start an application, GNOME automatically switches back to the workplace. The name of the program and its icon appear in the panel. You can end the application by clicking on it. The <guimenu>X</guimenu> on the title bar of its window does the same thing.

  <title>Working with Dash </title>
  <para>
  The small Dash in the <guimenu>Activities</guimenu> view not only keeps especially commonly used programs ready, but it can do even more: As soon as you start an application, an icon appears for it in the Dash. A light glow indicates that the application is running and (at least) one window is open.
  </para>
  <para>
  Right-clicking on an icon opens a small menu which offers different actions depending on the associated program. With <guimenu>Add to Favorites</guimenu>, you can place the application icon permanently in Dash. To remove a program icon from Dash, select <guimenu>Remove from Favorites</guimenu>. If you wish to rearrange an icon in the dock, hold the left mouse button pressed above it and then drag it to its new position.

  <title>Using Virtual Desktops</title>
  <para>
  GNOME allows you to organize your program window into several virtual desktops. If you often run a lot of programs simultaneously, this minimizes the number of windows to arrange on your screen.
