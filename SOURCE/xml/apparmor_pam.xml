 <title>Confining Users with <systemitem>pam_apparmor</systemitem></title>
 <para>
  An AppArmor profile applies to an executable program; if a portion of the
  program needs different access permissions than other portions need, the
  program can change hats via change_hat to a different role, also known as
  a subprofile. The pam_apparmor PAM module allows applications to confine
  authenticated users into subprofiles based on group names, user names, or
  a default profile. To accomplish this, pam_apparmor needs to be registered
  as a PAM session module.
