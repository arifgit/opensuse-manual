 <title>Advanced Disk Setup</title>
 <para>
  Sophisticated system configurations require specific disk setups. All
  common partitioning tasks can be done with YaST. To get persistent
  device naming with block devices, use the block devices below
  <filename>/dev/disk/by-id</filename> or
  <filename>/dev/disk/by-uuid</filename>. Logical Volume Management (LVM) is
  a disk partitioning scheme that is designed to be much more flexible than
  the physical partitioning used in standard setups. Its snapshot
  functionality enables easy creation of data backups. Redundant Array of
  Independent Disks (RAID) offers increased data integrity, performance, and
  fault tolerance. <phrase os="osuse">openSUSE</phrase> also supports multipath I/O
  , and there is also the option to use iSCSI as a
  networked disk.
