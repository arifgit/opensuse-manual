 <title>Managing Profiled Applications</title>
 <para>
  After creating profiles and immunizing your applications,
  <phrase os="sles;sled;osuse"><phrase os="osuse">openSUSE®</phrase></phrase>
  becomes more efficient and better protected as long as you perform
  AppArmor® profile maintenance (which involves analyzing log files, refining
  your profiles, backing up your set of profiles and keeping it up-to-date).
  You can deal with these issues before they become a problem by setting up
  event notification by e-mail, running periodic reports, updating profiles
  from system log entries by running the aa-logprof tool through YaST, and
  dealing with maintenance issues.

  <title>Reacting to Security Event Rejections</title>

  <para>
   When you receive a security event rejection, examine the access violation
   and determine if that event indicated a threat or was part of normal
   application behavior. Application-specific knowledge is required to make
   the determination. If the rejected action is part of normal application
   behavior, run <command>aa-logprof</command> at the command line or the
   <guimenu>Update Profile Wizard</guimenu> in AppArmor to update your profile.
  </para>

  <para>
   If the rejected action is not part of normal application behavior, this
   access should be considered a possible intrusion attempt (that was
   prevented) and this notification should be passed to the person
   responsible for security within your organization.
  </para>

  <title>Maintaining Your Security Profiles</title>

  <para>
   In a production environment, you should plan on maintaining profiles for
   all of the deployed applications. The security policies are an integral
   part of your deployment. You should plan on taking steps to back up and
   restore security policy files, plan for software changes, and allow any
   needed modification of security policies that your environment dictates.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="sec.apparmor.managing.maintain.backup">
   <title>Backing Up Your Security Profiles</title>
   <para>
    Backing up profiles might save you from having to reprofile all your
    programs after a disk crash. Also, if profiles are changed, you can
    easily restore previous settings by using the backed up files.
   </para>
   <para>
    Back up profiles by copying the profile files to a specified directory.
   </para>
   <procedure>
    <step performance="required">
     <para>
      You should first archive the files into one file. To do this, open a
      terminal window and enter the following as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:
     </para>
<screen>tar zclpf profiles.tgz /etc/apparmor.d</screen>
     <para>
      The simplest method to ensure that your security policy files are
      regularly backed up is to include the directory
      <filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename> in the list of directories that
      your backup system archives.
     </para>
    </step>

     <para>
      You can also use <command>scp</command> or a file manager like
      Konqueror or Nautilus to store the files on some kind of storage
      media, the network, or another computer.

   <title>Changing Your Security Profiles</title>
   <para>
    Maintenance of security profiles includes changing them if you decide
    that your system requires more or less security for its applications. To
    change your profiles in AppArmor, refer to

   <title>Introducing New Software into Your Environment</title>
   <para>
    When you add a new application version or patch to your system, you
    should always update the profile to fit your needs. You have several
    options, depending on your company's software deployment strategy. You
    can deploy your patches and upgrades into a test or production
    environment. The following explains how to do this with each method.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you intend to deploy a patch or upgrade in a test environment, the
    best method for updating your profiles is one of the following:

      Run the profiling wizard by selecting <guimenu>Add Profile
