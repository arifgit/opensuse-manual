 <title>AppArmor Profile Repositories</title>
 <para>
  AppArmor ships with a set of profiles enabled by default. These are
  created by the AppArmor developers, and are stored in
  <filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename>. In addition to these profiles,
  <phrase os="sles;sled;osuse"><phrase os="osuse">openSUSE</phrase></phrase>
  ships profiles for individual applications together with the relevant
  application. These profiles are not enabled by default, and reside under
  another directory than the standard AppArmor profiles,
  <filename>/etc/apparmor/profiles/extras</filename>.

 <sect1 id="sec.apparmor.repos.local">
  <title>Using the Local Repository</title>

  <para>
   The AppArmor tools (YaST and aa-genprof and aa-logprof) support the use of
   a local repository. Whenever you start to create a new profile from
   scratch, and there already is one inactive profile in your local
   repository, you are asked whether you would like to use the existing
   inactive one from <filename>/etc/apparmor/profiles/extras</filename> and
   whether you want to base your efforts on it. If you decide to use this
   profile, it gets copied over to the directory of profiles enabled by
   default (<filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename>) and loaded whenever AppArmor
   is started. Any further further adjustments will be done to the active
   profile under <filename>/etc/apparmor.d</filename>.
