  In GNOME, NetworkManager can be controlled with the GNOME NetworkManager icon. If the
  network is set up for NetworkManager control, the icon is automatically shown in the
  top bar.

  If your top bar does not show any network connection icon, GNOME NetworkManager
  is probably not started. Press <keycombo><keycap function="alt"/><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo> and enter
  <command>nm-applet</command> to start it manually.
