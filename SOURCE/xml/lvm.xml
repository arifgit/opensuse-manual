 <para>
  This section briefly describes the principles behind the Logical Volume
  Manager (LVM) and its multipurpose features. In
  <xref linkend="sec.yast2.system.lvm.yast"/>, learn how to set up LVM with
  YaST.
 </para>

 <warning>
  <para>
   Using LVM is sometimes associated with increased risk such as data loss.
   Risks also include application crashes, power failures, and faulty
   commands. Save your data before implementing LVM or reconfiguring
   volumes. Never work without a backup.

  <title>The Logical Volume Manager</title>
  <para>
   The LVM enables flexible distribution of hard disk space over several
   file systems. It was developed because sometimes the need to change the
   segmenting of hard disk space arises just after the initial partitioning
   has been done. Because it is difficult to modify partitions on a running
   system, LVM provides a virtual pool (volume group, VG for short) of
   memory space from which logical volumes (LVs) can be created as needed.
   The operating system accesses these LVs instead of the physical
   partitions. Volume groups can occupy more than one disk, so that several
   disks or parts of them may constitute one single VG. This way, LVM
   provides a kind of abstraction from the physical disk space that allows
   its segmentation to be changed in a much easier and safer way than with
   physical repartitioning. Background information regarding physical
   partitioning can be found in <xref linkend="sec.IB.part.typen"/> and
   <xref linkend="sec.yast2.i_y2_part_expert"/>.

  <para>
   <xref linkend="fig.lvm.explained.schematic"/> compares physical
   partitioning (left) with LVM segmentation (right). On the left side, one
   single disk has been divided into three physical partitions (PART), each
   with a mount point (MP) assigned so that the operating system can gain
   access. On the right side, two disks have been divided into two and three
   physical partitions each. Two LVM volume groups (VG 1 and VG 2)
   have been defined. VG 1 contains two partitions from DISK 1 and
   one from DISK 2. VG 2 contains the remaining two partitions
   from DISK 2. In LVM, the physical disk partitions that are
   incorporated in a volume group are called physical volumes (PVs). Within
   the volume groups, four LVs (LV 1 through LV 4) have been
   defined. They can be used by the operating system via the associated
   mount points. The border between different LVs do not need to be aligned
   with any partition border. See the border between LV 1 and LV 2
   in this example.

    <para>
     It is possible to activate a "striping mode" that distributes the data

  <para>
   With these features, LVM is ready for heavily used home PCs or small
   servers. LVM is well-suited for the user with a growing data stock (as in
   the case of databases, music archives, or user directories). This would
   allow file systems that are larger than the physical hard disk. Another
   advantage of LVM is that up to 256 LVs can be added. However, working
   with LVM is different from working with conventional partitions.
   Instructions and further information about configuring LVM is available
   in the official LVM HOWTO at
   <ulink url="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO/"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Starting from Kernel version 2.6, LVM version 2 is available,
   which is backward-compatible with the previous LVM and enables the
   continued management of old volume groups. When creating new volume
   groups, decide whether to use the new format or the backward-compatible
   version. LVM 2 does not require any kernel patches. It makes use of
   the device mapper integrated in kernel 2.6. This kernel only supports LVM
   version 2. Therefore, when talking about LVM, this section always
   refers to LVM version 2.

   <para>
    By using stripes it is possible to distribute the data stream in the LV
    among several PVs (striping). However, striping a volume can only be
    done over different PVs, each providing at least the amount of space of
    the volume. The maximum number of stripes equals to the number of PVs,
    where Stripe "1" means "no striping". Striping only makes sense with PVs
    on different hard disks, otherwise performance will decrease.

    <para>
     YaST cannot, at this point, verify the correctness of your entries
     concerning striping. Any mistake made here is apparent only later when
     the LVM is implemented on disk.
    </para>
   </warning>
   <para>
    If you have already configured LVM on your system, the existing logical
    volumes can also be used. Before continuing, assign appropriate mount
    points to these LVs. With <guimenu>Finish</guimenu>, return to the
    YaST Expert Partitioner and finish your work there.
