 <para>
  NetworkManager is the ideal solution for laptops and other portable computers. With
  NetworkManager, you do not need to worry about configuring network interfaces and
  switching between networks when you are moving.

 <sect2 id="sec.basicnet.nm.comparison">
  <title>NetworkManager and ifup</title>
  <para>
   However, NetworkManager is not a suitable solution for all cases, so you can still
   choose between the traditional method for managing network connections
   (ifup) and NetworkManager. If you want to manage your network connection with NetworkManager,
   enable NetworkManager in the YaST Network Settings module as described in
   <xref linkend="sec.nm.activate"/> and configure your network connections
   with NetworkManager. For a list of use cases and a detailed description how to
   configure and use NetworkManager, refer to <xref linkend="cha.nm"/>.
  </para>
  <para>
   Some differences between ifup and NetworkManager include:

    <listitem>
     <para>
      If you use NetworkManager for network setup, you can easily switch, stop or
      start your network connection at any time from an icon within your desktop
      environment. NetworkManager also makes it possible to change and
      configure wireless card connections without requiring <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
      privileges. For this reason, NetworkManager is the ideal solution for a mobile
      workstation.
     </para>
     <para>
      Traditional configuration with ifup also provides some ways to switch,
      stop or start the connection with or without user intervention, like
      user-managed devices. However, this always requires <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
      privileges to change or configure a network device. This is often a
      problem for mobile computing, where it is not possible to preconfigure
      all the connection possibilities.

     <para>
      Both traditional configuration and NetworkManager can handle network
      connections with a wireless network (with WEP, WPA-PSK, and
      WPA-Enterprise access) and wired networks using DHCP and static
      configuration. They also support connection through dial-up, DSL and
      VPN. With NetworkManager you can also connect a mobile broadband (3G)
      modem, which is not possible with the traditional configuration.
     </para>
     <para>
      NetworkManager tries to keep your computer connected at all times using the best
      connection available. If the network cable is accidentally
      disconnected, it tries to reconnect. It can find the network with the
      best signal strength from the list of your wireless connections and
      automatically use it to connect. To get the same functionality with
      ifup, a great deal of configuration effort is required.

 <sect2 id="sec.basicnet.nm.functionality">
  <title>NetworkManager Functionality and Configuration Files</title>
  <para>
   The individual network connection settings created with NetworkManager are stored
   in configuration profiles. The <emphasis>system</emphasis> connections
   configured with either NetworkManager or YaST are saved in
   <filename>/etc/networkmanager/system-connections/*</filename> or in
   <filename>/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-*</filename>. Any user-defined
   connections are stored in GConf for GNOME. 
  </para>
  <para>
   In case no profile is configured, NetworkManager automatically creates one and
   names it <literal>Auto $INTERFACE-NAME</literal>. That is made in an
   attempt to work without any configuration for as many cases as (securely)
   possible. If the automatically created profiles do not suit your needs,
   use the network connection configuration dialogs provided by KDE or GNOME
   to modify them as desired. For more information, refer to
   <xref linkend="sec.nm.configure"/>.

  <title>Controlling and Locking Down NetworkManager Features</title>
  <para>
   On centrally administered machines, certain NetworkManager features can be
   controlled or disabled with PolicyKit, for example if a user is allowed to
   modify administrator defined connections or if a user is allowed to
   define his own network configurations. To view or change the respective
   NetworkManager policies, start the graphical <guimenu>Authorizations</guimenu> tool
   for PolicyKit. In the tree on the left side, find them below the
   <guimenu>network-manager-settings</guimenu> entry.
