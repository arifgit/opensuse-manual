 <title>Basic VM Guest Management</title>
 <para>
  Basic management tasks such as starting or stopping a VM Guest, can
  either be done using the graphical application Virtual Machine Manager or on the command
  line using <command>virsh</command>. Connecting to the graphical console
  via VNC is only possible from a graphical user interface.

  <title>Listing VM Guests</title>

  <para>
   In order to be able to list VM Guests, you need to connect to a VM Host Server
   first. If you start the management tool on the VM Host Server itself, you are
   automatically connected. When operating from remote, refer to
   <xref linkend="sec.libvirt.connect.connecting"/> for instructions.

    The main Window of the Virtual Machine Manager shows a list of all VM Guests for each

    name, its status (<guimenu>Running</guimenu>, <guimenu>Paused</guimenu>,

  <title>Opening a Graphical Console</title>

  <para>
   Opening a Graphical Console to a VM Guest lets you interact with the
   machine like a physical host via a VNC connection. If accessing the VNC
   server requires authentication, you are prompted to enter a user name (if
   applicable) and a password.
  </para>

  <para>
   Once you click into the VNC console, the cursor is <quote>grabbed</quote>
   and cannot be used outside the console anymore. To release it, press
   <keycombo> <keycap function="alt"/> <keycap function="control"/>
   </keycombo>.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Seamless (Absolute) Cursor Movement</title>
   <para>
    In order to prevent the console from grabbing the cursor and to enable
    seamless cursor movement, add a tablet input device to the VM Guest.
    See <xref linkend="sec.libvirt.config.tablet"/> for more information.
   </para>
  </tip>

  <para>
   Certain key combinations such as <keycombo> <keycap function="control"/>
   <keycap function="alt"/> <keycap function="delete"/> </keycombo> are
   interpreted by the host system and are not passed to the VM Guest.
  </para>

  <para>
   To pass such key combinations to a VM Guest, open the <guimenu>Send
   Key</guimenu> menu from the VNC window and choose the desired key
   combination entry. The <guimenu>Send Key</guimenu> menu is only available
   when using Virtual Machine Manager and <command>virt-viewer</command>

  <note>
   <title>Supported VNC Viewer</title>
   <para>
    Principally all VNC viewers are able to connect to the console of a
    VM Guest. However, if you are using SASL authentication and/or TLS/SSL
    connection to access the guest, the options become limited. Common VNC
    viewers such as <literal>tightvnc</literal> or
    <literal>tigervnc</literal> support neither SASL authentication or
    TSL/SSL. The only supported alternative to Virtual Machine Manager and
    <command>virt-viewer</command> is <command>vinagre</command>.

  <title>Changing a VM Guest's State: Start, Stop, Pause</title>

  <para>
   Starting, stopping or pausing a VM Guest can either be done with Virtual Machine Manager
   or <command>virsh</command>. You can also configure a VM Guest to be
   automatically started when booting the VM Host Server.
  </para>

  <para>
   When shutting down a VM Guest, you may either shut it down gracefully,
   or force the shutdown. The latter is equivalent to pulling the power plug
   on a physical host and is only recommended if there are no alternatives.
   Forcing a shutdown may cause file system corruption and loss of data on
   the VM Guest.
  </para>

  <tip>
   <title>Graceful Shutdown</title>
   <para>
    In order to be able to perform a graceful shutdown, the VM Guest must
    be configured to support ACPI. If you have created the guest with
    <command>vm-install</command> or with Virtual Machine Manager, ACPI should be available.
    Use the following procedure in Virtual Machine Manager to check:
   </para>
   <para>
    Double-click the VM Guest entry in Virtual Machine Manager. Choose <menuchoice>
    <guimenu>View</guimenu> <guimenu>Details</guimenu> </menuchoice> and
    then <menuchoice> <guimenu>Overview</guimenu> <guimenu>Machine
    Settings</guimenu></menuchoice>. <guimenu>ACPI</guimenu> should be
    checked.
   </para>
   <para>
    Depending on the guest operating system, enabling ACPI may not be
    sufficient. It is strongly recommended to test shutting down and
    rebooting a guest before releasing it to production. openSUSE or
    SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop, for example, may require PolicyKit authorization for shutdown and
    reboot. Make sure this policy is turned off on all VM Guests.
   </para>
   <para>
    If ACPI was enabled during a Windows XP/Server 2003 guest installation,
    turning it on in the VM Guest configuration alone is not sufficient.
    See the following articles for more information:

    <member><ulink url="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=309283"/>
    </member>
   </simplelist>
   <para>
    A graceful shutdown is of course always possible from within the guest
    operating system, regardless of the VM Guest's configuration.

  <title>Saving and Restoring VM Guests</title>

  <para>
   Saving a VM Guest preserves the exact state of the guest’s memory. The
   operation is slightly similar to <emphasis>hibernating</emphasis> a
   computer. A saved VM Guest can be quickly restored to its previously
   saved running condition.
  </para>

  <para>
   When saved, the VM Guest is paused, its current memory state is saved to
   disk, and then the guest is stopped. The operation does not make a copy
   of any portion of the VM Guest’s virtual disk. The amount of time to
   save the virtual machine depends on the amount of memory allocated. When
   saved, a VM Guest’s memory is returned to the pool of memory available
   on the VM Host Server.
  </para>

  <para>
   The restore operation loads a VM Guest’s previously saved memory state
   file and starts it. The guest is not booted but rather resumes at the
   point where it was previously saved. The operation is slightly similar to
   coming out of hibernation.
  </para>

  <para>
   The VM Guest is saved to a state file. Make sure there is enough space
   on the partition you are going to save to. Issue the following command on
   the guest to get a rough estimation of the file size in megabytes to be
   expected:
  </para>

  <screen>free -m | awk '/^Mem:/ {print $3}'</screen>

  <warning>
   <para>
    After using the save operation, do not boot, start, or run the saved
    VM Guest. Doing so would cause the machine's virtual disk and the saved
    memory state getting out of sync and can result in critical errors when
    restoring the guest.
